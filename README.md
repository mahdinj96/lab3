# ENGO 651 Lab3

This lab contains a website that shows a map of the city of Calgary. On this map, a custom style is applied which changes the color, opacity, size, and other features of the map components. 
If the user does not like this style, or wants to see the original plain map provided by MapBox, they can click on the "Layer Off" button to get the original map style. Similarly, if they want the customized style back, they can execute the Layer On button to get the customized view on the map.
