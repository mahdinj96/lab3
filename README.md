# ENGO 651 Lab2

This lab contains a website which shows a map of the city of Calgary. On this map, a GeoJSON layer has been added which will show the information of buildings present in the city's database.
A search tool has been created to provide the user with a refinement in the data shown by letting them search for buildings with a specific time of issue. Each time the user clicks on the "Filter" button, the map will be refreshed with the new results.
